Episode 2 Final @ptpersonal

3
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,640
Let's go on a walk for a bit.

4
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,820
Where to?

5
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,990
You have to get on the ship that goes to Ming. I have prepared it for situations like this.

6
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,460
No, I don't want to run away.

7
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,540
It concerns your life.

8
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,650
Just once. Please don't have me go there just this one time.

9
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,930
I ran away to here as well.

10
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,990
You mustn't let that child live.

11
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,680
Do it for the greater good. I will promise you an official spot (rank five) in the court.

12
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,750
That child might have really come from the future.

13
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:08,110
Someone from the future...

14
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,670
Well...

15
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,770
There is no one more dangerous than him.

16
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,390
Pardon?

17
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:27,380
He ran frivolously to save him.

18
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,920
His Majesty has brought the trouble himself.

19
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,550
Eunuch, open your eyes. Just...

20
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,970
Look!

21
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:47,530
Don't drink it. Trapped water is full of rotten moss.

22
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,670
Well, it is not the fault of the moss.

23
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:55,690
It is the fault of the humans that trap nature for their convenience.

24
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,430
Let's go.

25
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,670
Oh gosh.

26
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,580
I'm right. You are a girl.

27
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:11,100
What are you saying?

28
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,490
- Then, a deungmok?
(when men pour water on their backs with their tops off)
- I hate taking showers.

29
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,570
It is not going to change anything, even if you are a girl.

30
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:22,210
I knew it ever since my brother kept calling you Noona.

31
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,490
I didn't try to deceive you on purpose.

32
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:31,820
I got the job because I was a guy, and I was a bit scared as well. That's why.

33
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:37,820
I will keep it from the king if you double the fee.

34
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,110
You seem like a nice person.

35
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:48,570
I thought you were a jerk at first.

36
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:53,270
Well, I am doing the math, whether to take the rank five position.

37
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:58,110
Or to take at minimum a rank four by saving the king's woman.

38
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,940
Well, right now, you're mine.

39
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,760
How could you have given such a order?

40
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,900
If that child is a spy, then everything you wanted to achieve

41
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,600
disappears.

42
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,210
I'm going to go look for that child.

43
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,650
Your Majesty.

44
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,960
Give up on your personal feelings.

45
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,700
He said to run towards the time. Go first.

46
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,810
- By myself?
- Then do you want to die together here?

47
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,440
Here.

48
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,750
Good luck.

49
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,900
♫ Life is just like this, woohoo, it does make sense though ♫

50
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,900
♫ Is it everyone's fault? I know everyone ♫

51
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,770
Ah!
♫ Shut up! ♫

52
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:28,270
♫ Does singing make you forget?
Does loving someone makes you get loved? ♫

53
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:32,290
♫ Does being rich makes you successful? You go faster on a car ♫

54
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,160
♫ Shut up! ♫

55
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,600
Ah! Argh!
♫ Shut up! Shut up! ♫

56
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,770
♫ Shut up! Shut up and listen to me! ♫

57
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,930
♫ We have to run! We can't make fools of ourselves ♫

58
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:57,840
♫ Run, horsie! Let's run! ♫

59
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:00,830
Oppa gangnam style!

60
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,770
Gangnam style!

61
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:07,430
Oppa Gangnam style!
♫ Run, horsie! ♫

62
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,980
Gangnam style!

63
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,700
Oppa Gangnam style!

64
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:20,700
Oh, yeah! Oh, oh, oh, oh, Oppa Gangnam style!
♫ Run, horsie! ♫

65
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,500
He told you to run towards the time.

66
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,090
Under the sky of Joseon, the sun is the time.

67
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,440
Time is the sun.

68
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,790
Westward.

69
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,580
You knew about this, didn't you?

70
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:37,220
What am I going to do?

71
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,900
Did you walk by yourself all the way here?

72
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,770
It must be hard to endure everything by yourself.

73
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,260
Let go of me!

74
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,320
I can go alone! I am going to find them.

75
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:51,360
If it is the sun of a country, then that represents me.

76
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,750
I colored it like a real bird, right?

77
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,850
Then, I'll make it sound like a bird.

78
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:03,550
Wow, I want to blow it too!

79
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,300
Give it to me.

80
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:37,050
You were also bearing it alone, putting up a front.

81
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,410
That day was the exam day that my life depended on.

82
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:48,980
One of the most important days of my life.

83
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,570
I thought about why I ended up here out of all places,

84
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,710
but I think it was just my choice.

85
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:05,230
Whether it was Joseon or anywhere else, I just intended to disappear to somewhere far.

86
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:10,100
"Mi" means not yet, and "rae" means to come.
(The word for "future" is pronounced "mi-rae")

87
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:15,560
So, you came from the days that haven't come yet?

88
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,040
You're telling me to believe that?

89
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,580
Did you live your whole life getting fooled?

90
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,960
It's time you believed me!

91
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:28,370
Then...

92
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:32,310
Look at this.

93
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:37,210
Wow... How can the sky fit into this thing?

94
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,400
It's pretty, right?

95
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:43,710
If you look at this, you wouldn't have to look up at the sky.

96
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,530
What?

97
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:46,930
What happened?

98
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,830
Ah, the battery died.

99
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:53,670
Yeah, it is better to have something permanent.

100
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:02,170
Wow... This really is Joseon.

101
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,780
There are so many stars.

102
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:12,020
Those precious stars tell us the date and the time.

103
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,450
In the future, there aren't many stars.

104
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:21,630
You can only see the few brightest stars and the others are as if they don't exist at all.

105
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,730
Look well.

106
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:30,120
At first, you only see the brightest star,

107
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,740
but if you keep looking like this...

108
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:39,140
See? The less bright ones

109
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,420
eventually start to shine more brightly.

110
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,390
Wow, I can really see more now.

111
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,950
The stars are not actually shining brighter,

112
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:53,200
but the person's will to see them is becoming bigger.

113
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,490
L

114
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,190
O

115
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,270
V

116
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,470
E

117
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,040
- Me too...
- What?

118
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,390
You love me?

119
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,710
So suddenly?

120
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:37,940
© ptpersonal.site All rights reserved.

121
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:45,490
I lived without even knowing there were so many stars on Hanyang's sky.

122
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:51,500
There were a lot of instruments covered with dust.

123
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,280
Even now, how does moving to the Department of Music sound?

124
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,540
If I talk to my father...

125
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:07,090
I was just trying to help!

126
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,040
L.

127
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,100
O.

128
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:17,880
V.

129
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,020
E.

130
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,690
Love.

131
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:25,250
This means love.

132
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,920
The Westerners' characters...

133
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,630
They have their own characters, too.

134
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,830
I'm depressed. I feel like we're getting behind.

135
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:40,770
When you're depressed, this is the best. Sweets.

136
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,160
It looks bitter. I won't eat it.

137
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:49,180
No, no! It's really sweet! Try one.

138
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:57,690
Someday, I will make Joseon's own characters.

139
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:04,700
So peasants like you can live life comfortably.

140
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,120
That is why I am learning math from you.

141
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,620
The combination of consonants and vowels doesn't come from anywhere.

142
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:30,010
Why are you staring at me like that?

143
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,620
Do I

144
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:37,090
look handsome?

145
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,100
Your Majesty, you're...

146
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,000
You will definitely make it.

147
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,060
Wow... This is amazing. Should I get his autograph?

148
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,510
Ah, you're much more handsome!

149
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:56,250
Did you fall into me again?

150
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:00,030
Later, I will write your name, too.

151
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,640
Wow.

152
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,690
Wow.

153
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:17,270
Wow, this... What is this?

154
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:20,210
I told you it's good!

155
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:23,220
- Wow!
- Wow!

156
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,980
Wow...

157
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,530
Wow.

158
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:59,320
Wow... What's this?

159
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,510
Well...

160
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,440
Chisus?
(Chicken + Jesus)

161
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,020
Chisus?

162
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:22,490
It is amusing how they keep appearing from your bag.

163
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:26,240
I know, right? Why is this here?

164
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,690
Dan Bi! Dan Bi!

165
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,510
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

166
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,600
Wait!

167
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,440
My daughter, you can do it! Fighting!

168
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,980
You can do a good job! Fighting! Fighting!

169
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,900
Mom...

170
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,810
I really liked this when I was young.

171
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:55,740
Oh... I'm sorry.

172
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,160
No...

173
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,670
What's wrong?

174
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:11,650
Don't cry! It's a royal command.

175
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,520
When you're depressed, this is the best. Sweets.

176
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,440
♫ Should I gently melt this fluttering heart? ♫

177
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,210
♫ Should I turn up the heat to making it warmer? ♫

178
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:34,800
♫ If you take just one bite, I think it will be enough to liquefy you ♫

179
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:39,470
♫  Should I get a taste of your sweet confession? ♫

180
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:43,530
♫ The second bite would make me dizzy ♫

181
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,600
Don't cry.
♫  Those words will come out automatically ♫

182
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:51,470
♫ I love you  ♫

183
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,060
Hm?

184
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,900
How is it your fault?

185
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:44,040
It is the fault of the humans who manipulate nature for their own needs.

186
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:02,350
The water didn't drip at a constant speed because the moss, produced from trapping the water, was blocking the way.

187
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:06,350
So, if I fix it to drip at a constant pace, then my calculation is right.

188
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,280
I wouldn't have solved it by myself.

189
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:17,610
Hurry up! You are frustrating me.

190
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:22,390
Don't nag at me. Anyway, we are going to share the achievement fairly.

191
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,380
High five!

192
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,550
I will grant the intern the rank four for his achievement,

193
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:38,500
and the eunuch will be forgiven.

194
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,550
Your grace is immeasurable.

195
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,090
I am sorry to tell you,

196
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,810
but you should kick that eunuch out of the palace.

197
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:53,380
If status gets in the way of someone who cares about the people,

198
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:57,090
you should grant him a status.

199
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:03,920
How about a rank three position?

200
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:11,130
Lord, whose side are you on?

201
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:15,540
I'm on the people's side.

202
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,040
Times table. Times table.

203
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,220
- Six times six.
- Thirty-six.

204
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,130
Times table.

205
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,550
- Seven times eight.
- Uh...

206
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,550
Please save me. Please.

207
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,960
Save me...

208
00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:02,370
Look here. The earth rotates around the sun. Round and round.

209
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:05,460
Do you understand what I am saying?

210
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:09,540
Oh. I have my hair tie.

211
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:17,130
So, this is the sun, and the stars are rotating around it.

212
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:22,580
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,

213
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:28,220
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.

214
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,820
Venus.

215
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,090
Say Venus again.

216
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,750
Venus.

217
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:41,830
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,

218
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:45,020
Jupiter, Saturn...

219
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:49,760
- Are you listening?
- Yes. Go on.

220
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:55,670
The stars are rotating around the sun.

221
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,450
Giyeok (Korean alphabet for K, G)

222
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,040
Nieun (Korean alphabet for N)

223
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,590
So!

224
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:41,920
It's delicious, right?

225
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,750
Well...

226
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,220
You eat so well!

227
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:52,830
It must be spicy.

228
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:55,840
I'm okay. I can handle this much.

229
00:26:57,050 --> 00:27:00,930
You really resemble my friend.

230
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:06,430
You don't seem unfamiliar to me either.

231
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,210
Did you say people from the future know everything?

232
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:17,960
No, not really.
(She says this informally.)

233
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,880
Yo...
(Formal suffix)

234
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,140
About the skirt... I want to color it like the starlight,

235
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,630
but there's no color for it.

236
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:42,170
I saw this on SNS...

237
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:47,590
I've never seen that before...

238
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:54,120
Where do you want to color?

239
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,910
Here and there.

240
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,380
This is so cool!

241
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:17,470
So pretty.

242
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,220
How could you say something so frustrating?

243
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,550
His Majesty and that girl spent the night together!

244
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:26,300
Anyway, this is something that I have to accept.

245
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,630
Just this time, if you trust me and wait...

246
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:35,370
Yes, my daughter! You did a very good job!

247
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:40,500
How could you let this situation occur? You should have taken better care of your man.

248
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:45,550
This time, I want to take care of this, Father.

249
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:13,460
A rank is good after all. It feels so good!

250
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:24,260
His Majesty is entering.

251
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:35,170
Your Majesty, I told Her Highness the Dowager Queen about everything, so you don't have to keep everything to yourself.

252
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:38,340
I'm talking about that child.

253
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,540
Your Majesty.

254
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:49,420
You should have made her your concubine instead of an official.

255
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:05,670
What kind of position is this?

256
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:09,300
You're preparing for the flower sleep with His Majesty.

257
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,500
Flower sleep? What is that?

258
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,920
Flower sleep is an old saying that means the first night

259
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:18,870
Are they crazy? A concubine?

260
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:21,500
Am I Jang Hui Bin?
(Jang Hee Bin was a beautiful concubine of King Seok Jong.)

261
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:26,680
After spending the night with her, make her a Hui Bin.
(Hui Bin is the title given to the royal noble consort, rank one)

262
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:35,380
She disappeared on the way to your palace.

264
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,730
Oh my, oh my gosh!

265
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,780
Hey, hey, they said that I would get kicked out if I'm a girl,

266
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:03,420
and you said to be friends first!

267
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:06,750
And I'm only nineteen years old!

268
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:09,670
Really? If you're nineteen, you should have three kids by now.

269
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:12,620
Since you lie every time you open your mouth, let me see for myself.

270
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:16,350
Ah, no! No!

271
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:24,170
There.

272
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:28,840
Do you think I didn't know that you're a woman?

273
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,390
I hugged you so many times. Do you think I'm stupid?

274
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:34,200
Noona!
(Older sister)

275
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,040
Noona!

276
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,800
Noona?

277
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:48,540
The reason I kept quiet about it up to now for some time  is because I wanted to be closer to you.

278
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:54,010
It wouldn't have been possible if the fact you're a girl was discovered, since so many people would keep an eye on us.

279
00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:01,550
What can we do now? Mother wants to make you a Hui Bin now.

280
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:07,040
My mom is really stubborn. I am not sure how long I can stop her.

281
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:13,630
Don't worry. I don't want to rush it.

282
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:18,080
Everyone is frantic looking for you. So, just hide here for today.

283
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:26,090
You will be the safest here.

284
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:30,670
Don't worry. I won't eat you. Now I'm going off to do work.

285
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:38,250
Oh, did I say this before?  Or not?

286
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:44,250
Today... You... You look pretty.

287
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,130
Are you asleep?

288
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,000
You scared me!

289
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,620
Why are you pretending to sleep?

290
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,780
I woke up because you talked to me.

291
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:28,390
How can you sleep in this situation? Are you a man?
Let me check...

292
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:31,200
I should confirm it by...

293
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:42,100
I can't communicate with my mother. Can't she just trust me?

294
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:47,790
Before I even do anything, she nags so much.

295
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:50,920
My mom's like that too.

296
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:57,410
The next time it rains,

297
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:04,340
don't go.

298
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:07,000
Hm?

299
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:13,170
I thought I needed you only because you were useful to bring the rain, but then...

300
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,970
But it's not like that.

301
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,720
I'm not that useful, right?

302
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,050
What I want to say is...

303
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:33,300
If you're beside me, that's enough for me.

304
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:41,130
It's not because I need you. You're enough for me.

305
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:50,510
Just having you beside me is enough.

306
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,460
Hey, hey...

307
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:10,620
- Oh, gosh.
- Let's just sleep since it is so awkward.

308
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:23,970
I heard you talked about our own calendar with His Majesty.

309
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:29,910
It's all your fault. I have been working all night on it.

310
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,730
Ah.

311
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:35,920
Ah, you are so annoying.

312
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,050
Use this to clean your hands.

313
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,790
King Sejong and Jang Yeong Sil...

314
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,390
It must be nice that all of you are great people. What am I going to do with myself?

315
00:36:54,390 --> 00:37:00,630
What do you mean by that?  For a peasant to become a concubine is the best boost a woman could have.

316
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:06,130
Becoming a concubine means I am going to be those evil ladies in the palace.

317
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:09,450
I never imagined my life like that.

318
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:15,250
Also, I'm afraid of pointlessly influencing history.

319
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:20,520
What if he doesn't create hangul for my sake?
(Hangul is the Korean alphabet)

320
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,530
What a joke.

321
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:28,090
There are stuff like that. It isn't like you know any of them.

322
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:31,310
Don't think of it that easily.

323
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:35,500
The Queen must have prudently approved.

324
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:41,520
But, I have to go back.

325
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,120
Are you sure you want to go back?

326
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,940
Why do I never have answers.

327
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:11,690
This matches very well.

328
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,660
Beside me, in Joseon.

329
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:24,530
Beside me, in Joseon.

330
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:26,360
Let's live together.

331
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,950
Beside me, in Joseon.

332
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:37,940
Beside me, in Joseon, let's live together.

333
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:52,620
So you're here?

334
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:00,930
Follow me. Someone is expecting  to see you.

335
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,930
Mom...

336
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:54,890
My dear, why are you crying?

337
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,550
What's the matter, huh?

338
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,270
My my...

339
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,560
Child.

340
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,990
Your Majesty.

341
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:22,830
How is it? This is Joseon's astronomy app.

342
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:27,740
With this, Joseon can develop its own calendar.

343
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:31,150
You helped me again.

344
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:39,100
What is this? You became ugly again.

345
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:44,400
I guess clothing is important to women.  You look like some kind of a carp...

346
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,720
Did you cry?

347
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,380
I don't really like how you look right now.

348
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,740
But let's go anyway. I have something to show you.

349
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:16,600
Consonants and vowels, I have made total of 28 letters.

350
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:23,190
Now, you and the people of Joseon can read and write.

351
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:27,890
Anyone who wants to learn will be granted a chance.

352
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,350
Sit down.

353
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:37,040
Stay with me as long as the sun rises and sets.

354
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,340
This time, it is an absolute order.

355
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,780
These are the first few words I wrote in jungeum.
(Old Hangul)

356
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,160
The name I have personally granted to you.

357
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:00,040
I really want to go back when the rain comes.

358
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:05,860
I think it will rain soon.

359
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:14,580
I still won't have answers even if I go back,

360
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:19,180
but I have many things I have to do.

361
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:26,810
There is someone who trusts and waits for me, like you.

362
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,810
I miss my mom so much.

363
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:41,530
Alright... Look at me.

364
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:48,540
You can come back after you meet her. How about living here all together?

365
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,130
I keep living while running away.

366
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:59,030
Then... What am I to you?

367
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:03,360
A dream.

368
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,290
A dream?

369
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,660
A dream may not go back.

370
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:24,780
This is an order.

371
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:33,060
It is a request from the king.

372
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,320
I am sorry.

373
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,460
In any case,

374
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:49,490
the future is a whole lot better than

375
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:53,690
this Joseon full of diseases and droughts.

376
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:57,150
Right.

377
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:00,490
Do what your heart wishes.

378
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:15,400
© ptpersonal.site All rights reserved.

379
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:29,610
You are someone as nice as

380
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:34,150
a person I dreamed about.

381
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:19,430
Father!

382
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:23,260
Daughter! It is best to get rid of any likely problems.

383
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:24,360
No!

384
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,180
Please go back to your senses!

385
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:28,980
In a palace without anyone to talk to,

386
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:32,510
it was the first time of dreaming for a friend.

387
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:38,750
You asked me what I wanted. You scolded me for not having a dream.

388
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:41,680
My dream is

389
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:47,770
not feeling lonely in this nasty palace.

390
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:51,130
Dad!

391
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:33,500
Your Majesty!

392
00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:55,440
It's too dangerous, Your Majesty. Please return back to your quarters.

393
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,910
Move.

394
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:25,830
Eunuch.

395
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,290
Eunuch...

396
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:33,730
It is this dangerous beside me, but

397
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:37,780
I tried to keep you next to me.

398
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,890
I'm sorry.

399
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:24,990
Your Majesty.

400
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:29,340
I heard the bomb disappeared last night.

401
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:37,470
You are the one I ordered to work on it. If you have anything to say, spit it out.

402
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:41,970
You rascal! Who do you think you are?

403
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:46,260
Your Majesty, please punish me for not preventing this.

404
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:49,000
I deserve to be abandoned.

405
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:54,470
That's right, I should get rid of you.

406
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:04,710
Didn't you teach him how to clean himself after dealing with the bomb?

407
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:06,540
Please forgive me.

408
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:12,530
- Why did that happen?
- Your Majesty…

409
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:16,120
How could I, the one assisting you from this close, do such a thing?

410
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:19,340
It was this man's voice you heard, correct?

411
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,250
Yes.

412
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:30,360
No… How did you?

413
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:39,270
It will burn very rapidly. Let's go.

414
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:50,590
- It must be Kim Young Chul.
- It's Kim Young Chul!

415
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:56,710
I can't do math, but I am good at recognizing voices.

416
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:05,400
You, who are in the position closest to me.

417
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,420
How can you do this to me?

418
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:13,250
Your Majesty.

419
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:21,300
If hanminjungeum (hangul) gets published, the young people will dare to develop and share their own thoughts.

420
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:27,590
A scary world without any discipline will come. The world will turn upside down.

421
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:30,640
Death doesn't scare me.

422
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:39,110
But, a future where we will be useless scares me.

423
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:45,620
Even if you stop me, I will give the the writing system to the people.

424
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:52,770
That's right. I will become the kind of king who does what the people want.

425
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:03,810
What if someone becomes useless?

426
00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:05,330
It is a person anyway.

427
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:13,170
Don't abandon today and run away, for the sake of a day that hasn't come yet.

428
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:20,460
Don't be so afraid of your use in this world.

429
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:22,040
Your Majesty.

430
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:27,750
Your Majesty, please execute me!

431
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:33,930
Please execute us!

432
00:53:58,310 --> 00:54:01,020
That's your dream.

433
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:05,190
Everything should have been burnt. How could this...

434
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:14,810
Your dream will let everyone in Joseon read and write.

435
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:25,400
We will always be thankful and have good thoughts, so don't be too sad.

436
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:31,520
It must be true, the future you are trying to go to.

437
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,810
You finally believe me.

438
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:43,920
I apologize, but I don't think this can maintain my dream.

439
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:51,290
Because my dream is you. For the sake of Joseon, I need to keep you.

440
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:56,150
The answer I couldn't find no matter how much I thought is you.

441
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:05,520
Look, it is a rainy season in three years.

442
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:10,220
How did you know this?

443
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:15,550
Somehow, I just thought so.

444
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:24,890
Greet the teacher.

445
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:27,600
Alright, good work.

446
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:31,200
Ah, what's with this rain?

447
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:40,840
Joseon is livable even if you are not so good at math.

448
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:46,530
Let's go. I'll follow you as far as I can.

449
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:48,730
No, I'm alright.

450
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:52,390
Nonsense. It's an order.

451
00:55:57,310 --> 00:55:59,420
Live well.

452
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:03,910
I'm leaving.

453
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:07,910
I'm thankful, friend.

454
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:09,520
What are you doing?

455
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:12,310
Last month's rent.

456
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:15,520
So you are going to be like this to the end.

457
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:19,880
My name is Yeon, Park Yeon.

458
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,050
You're not Jang Yeong Sil?

459
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:23,560
What are you talking about?

460
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:27,390
The music prodigy

461
00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:31,490
Never give up on music, okay?

462
00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:34,720
I'm really going now. Live doing what you want.

463
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:37,590
Park Yeon, Seok, goodbye!

464
00:56:39,290 --> 00:56:41,170
Hyung.

465
00:56:58,870 --> 00:57:01,300
Can't I ride in the front?

466
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:15,550

486
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:20,950
♫ A star that just started shining, a wind that blows hard ♫

487
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:27,380
♫ I won't cry, goodbye ♫

488
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:33,670
♫ An overwhelming day, after a long time ♫

489
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:40,120
♫ I hope this imperfect song gets to you ♫

490
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:46,340
♫ On this long journey, I hope endless blessings ♫

491
00:59:46,370 --> 00:59:50,040
♫ will stay with you ♫

492
01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:02,910
One day I will find you.

493
01:00:02,910 --> 01:00:05,290
No matter how long a time may pass.

494
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:28,350
Hey, you...

495
01:00:46,570 --> 01:00:50,500
♫ I wish you good luck ♫

496
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:56,760
♫ to be with you ♫

497
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:01,830
Wait... You...

498
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,960
Just come in and sit down.

499
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:10,540
In a moment, the test will begin.

500
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:17,540
Make sure you are in the correct seat, and get ready for the test.

501
01:01:26,870 --> 01:01:30,840
This person not only has great craftsmanship,

502
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:33,400
but he is extraordinarily intelligent

503
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:38,370
that he discussed issues directly to me.

504
01:01:38,370 --> 01:01:41,030
However, how can I call this an achievement?

505
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:45,530
He just made a water clock. Even if he got my help,

506
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:49,880
without this person, it would never have been made.
♫ Fading away in my memories ♫

507
01:01:52,350 --> 01:01:58,090
If you are planning to give him a position, you would need his name.
♫ The name that is burnt in my heart ♫

508
01:01:58,090 --> 01:02:03,510
That child's name is Yeong Sil.
♫ I am trying to call it and call it ♫

509
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:07,540
The is a clever ("yeong") and a full ("sil") name.

510
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:11,310
No, that's not it. I meant I can't get attached to him.
♫ Scattered in the wind ♫

511
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:18,180
♫ Your slender shoulders ♫

512
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:22,400
These are the first words I have ever written with jungeum.
(Old hangul)
♫ like the clouds above ♫

513
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:26,400
♫ which follow time ♫

514
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:29,660
The name I have personally granted to you.
[ Jang Yeong Sil ]

515
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:37,270
♫ are dispersing into whiteness  ♫

516
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:42,680
♫ I am missing you too much ♫
[ Jang Yeong Sil ]

517
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:46,800
♫ You are so common that  ♫

518
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:52,070
♫ Without touching a part♫

519
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:59,400
♫ The sky blazes and turns red  ♫

520
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:05,350
♫ I really missed you, missing you ♫

521
01:03:05,350 --> 01:03:08,700
♫ Because I missed you so much ♫

522
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:16,910
♫ Today, as well, we are together under the bright moonlight ♫

523
01:03:16,910 --> 01:03:18,580
♫ Holding hands ♫

524
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:22,050
♫  Shining us ♫

525
01:03:22,050 --> 01:03:24,460
♬ Having kissed ♬

526
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:28,060
♫ Unforgettable us ♫

527
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:32,690
♫I decided to ask everything. ♫

528
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:39,340
♫I decided to ask everything. ♫

529
01:03:56,550 --> 01:04:05,760
Work hard next time to come to the first row. How could they even rank cup ramens?

530
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:10,170
You are all precious. You are all uniquely tasty.

531
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:14,050
Did you register to the prep school I was going to?

532
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:16,720
Don't nag, freshmen. I will do that later.

533
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:21,800
Look at this, jaesoosaeng.
(Someone who prepares to go to college even after graduating from high school.)

534
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,590
What is it?

535
01:04:23,590 --> 01:04:26,250
Splash Splash LOVE?

536
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:29,630
This is a manhwa based on your dreams, and it has been getting so many hearts.

537
01:04:29,630 --> 01:04:34,830
- Oh...
- But I heard King Sejong had tons of women.

538
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:36,690
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

539
01:04:36,690 --> 01:04:42,590
He is known to give clementines to every woman he liked. Also he had twenty children in total.

540
01:04:48,830 --> 01:04:51,740
They must get along well.

541
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:54,720
Who is that? He is so hot.

542
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:59,840
