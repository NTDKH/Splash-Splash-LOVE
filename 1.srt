00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,690
Jang Dan Bi!

4
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,090
Keep going. What is three times six?

5
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,230
What's three times six?

6
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,640
You have the SATs in two days. What are you going to do?

7
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,530
Why are you carrying around your brain? It's heavy, isn't it?

8
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,840
Jang Dan Bi!

9
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,920
Have you memorized the times table? Can you do it?

10
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,560
Three.

11
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,230
Two.

12
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,790
One.

13
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,640
Yes!

14
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,290
What's with this rain?

15
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,680
Aigoo, my leg.

16
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:58,110
♬ On your picture I'm holding in my hands ♬

17
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,350
Pythagoras' identity is...

18
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,410
- It's Kim Young Chul.
- It's comedian Kim Young Chul!

19
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,380
Aigoo... That's no use.

20
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,260
If you solved math problems with that ability,

21
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,410
Seoul University would have scouted you already.

22
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:17,850
Your dad was also having problems with math, so you got his genes, all right.

23
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,270
What's the use of bearing you with a perfectly functioning body?

24
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,950
Ah, you're always watching historical dramas! Gross!

25
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:30,710
Since you missed early entry, and the SAT is all that is left... have you decided on a major yet?

26
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:34,760
Since you resemble me, you should be smart. Why aren't you trying?

27
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,210
I wonder what you can do to make a living without me.

28
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,400
I can eat well and live well alone, so don't worry.

29
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,990
You would live only watching TV and your phone.

30
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:45,430
Ah, Mom, you're always watching historical dramas, yourself!

31
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,990
You won't leave me alone!

32
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:51,050
Exactly what is it that you like?

33
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:54,830
If you don't have anything you like, perhaps there is something you're good at!

34
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:58,820
- If I was born in that time period, I probably wouldn't have done math.
- Hey, where are you going?

35
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,980
You should tell me where you're going, do you even have a dream?

36
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,260
Hey, Jang Dan Bi!

37
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,420
Shut up! Shut up!

38
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,540
Shut up!

39
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,900
Shut up and listen to me!

40
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,650
I'm going crazy because there's not enough time, but even if there's more time, it's not going to change anything.

41
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,370
I wish I could disappear.

42
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,720
It would be nice.

43
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,710
Get into a S.K.Y. university (Korea's Ivy League) and pursue your dream and mine as well.

44
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:41,430
Shut up. Would they stay still if I told them that I'm going to art school?

45
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,210
They won't even let me eat this.

46
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:49,400
Hey, and if you're unlucky on SAT day, isn't it over?

47
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,730
Your life is ruined.

48
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,130
How can a person's life depend on just one day?

49
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:58,560
If I go to a random university, would I get hired in my next life?

50
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,080
Why was I born like this? So useless...

51
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,540
Hey! Is there a hole in your mouth?

52
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,150
I can say I had a nosebleed.

53
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,720
Why don't I ever get nosebleeds?

54
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,270
Hey, my dad's here.

55
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,510
I'm going.

56
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:55,340
Finally, the 2016 National College Scholastic Aptitude Test day is here.

57
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,710
In the capital area, heavy rain is expected.

58
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,750
Reporter Kang Hee Jin will tell you about the situation of the SAT day morning.

59
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,080
Hey! Dan Bi! Dan Bi!

60
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,860
Hey, hey!

61
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,840
Hey! Dan Bi!

62
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,060
- What is this?
- I'm eating this with So Heon. It isn't like you care, anyway.

63
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,080
You know that if you ruin the SATs today, there is no hope.

64
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,280
Just try your best. Okay?

65
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,960
There wasn't a time when I didn't try my best.

66
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,130
This wench. Today is the last day I'm serving you!

67
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,960
It is not like you served me anything.

68
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,180
My daughter, you can do it! Fighting!

69
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,330
You can do a good job! Fighting! Fighting!

70
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,130
Classical Literature

71
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,600
Thank you.

72
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,350
My umbrella?

73
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,570
Perfect score in the SAT
Pass the university entrance exam

74
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,780
If not today, there is no hope for life

75
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,650
Pass the test

76
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,340
If you're unlucky on the SAT day, isn't it all over anyway?

77
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:25,770
You know that if you flunk the SATs today, there is no hope.

78
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,820
2016 SATs Testing Session

79
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,420
Aren't you coming?

80
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,060
Please make me disappear.

81
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,730
Please, just this one time.

82
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:11,920
Many lives have been lost to the drought.

83
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,520
And everyone has been looking to the sky

84
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,720
wishing for rain to quench their thirst.

85
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:28,740
We will pay for the King's lack of virtue by burning his robes.

86
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:38,120
Please forgive him by taking all the fault transferred to his gown and grant us rain.

87
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:45,790
Powerful demon god.

88
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,720
Powerful demon god!

89
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,410
Please grant us rain.

90
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:57,270
Please grant us rain.

91
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:20,300
I told you that it wasn't going to work...

92
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,180
From now on, there will be no rituals for the rain.

93
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,800
Dismiss yourselves.

94
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,150
It is coming.

95
00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:00,160
The heaven nymph (rain) is coming.

96
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:06,700
Finally, after the three year drought, there will be rain in Joseon!

97
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,340
Are you filming a historical drama?

98
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,990
My phone.

99
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,610
Are you a human or a goblin? Who are you?

100
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,010
M-me?

101
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:10,320
I'm just a high school senior.
(Pronounced as "gosam")

102
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,030
Eunuch?
(Pronounced as "gosam")

103
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:18,360
The word for a high school senior and a eunuch is pronounced the same, as "gosam"

104
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:24,240
Chief of Eunuchs, is he also a eunuch?

105
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,720
One out of two eunuchs became mad because of the shock and was disqualified,

106
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:35,700
and it is not uncommon for them to break into the palace out of a grudge.

107
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,370
- Teacher! Teacher, where is this?
- Get up there!

108
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:46,060
What is this all of a sudden—

109
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,350
Blood... Real swords?

110
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:52,550
Stop it. That is the gift sent to Joseon by the Heavens.

111
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:55,850
He will save us from the drought in Joseon!

112
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:01,580
Heaven nymph, please stop the drought.

113
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,020
J-Joseon?

114
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:07,670
The Heavens, please let rain fall.

115
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:12,290
Please let rain fall!

116
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,210
Me?

117
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:18,450
The Heavens, please let rain fall.

118
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:21,140
Ah, I really hate historical dramas.

119
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:26,930
Let the rain fall!

120
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:30,190
Let that happen!

121
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:35,330
Now that I am here, rain will fall.

122
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:42,160
Please let rain fall!

123
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:50,850
Please let rain fall!

124
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:03,120
He disappeared?

125
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,650
Seriously... What's with this?

126
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:09,070
This way!

127
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:13,360
Find him! He ran that way!

128
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,840
Over there!

129
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,000
Let's go.

130
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,550
His Majesty the King is entering!

131
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:55,210
I will pluck out the eyes and execute the eunuch who insulted me.

132
00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:00,130
I will not only rely on superstition for the important things of Joseon.

133
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:05,590
From now on, math and science will be used to solve problems.

134
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:08,180
I'm afraid, Your Majesty,

135
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:12,290
that math is a trick rather than a science.

136
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:16,050
It is against our tradition to use math.

137
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,760
Your Majesty.

138
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,850
How could you know the plan of nature from arithmetics?

139
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:28,030
- Please reconsider.
- Please reconsider.

140
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:32,870
According to the Sung Soo Chung (weather department), the reason behind this drought

141
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:38,070
is that the sky is mad because the father of the country is not producing his heir.

142
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:43,300
So please, spend the night with your Queen on the chosen day.

143
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:48,670
- Please reconsider.
- Please reconsider.

144
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,050
Please...

145
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:10,440
Drought and plague? It is as if the sky (God) is helping us to turn the King into a puppet.

146
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,900
What a relief it is that no rain fell...

147
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,450
What have you been eating?

148
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,090
It's a nosebleed...

149
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:26,250
You should take care of yourself, especially as the day for intimacy is soon.

150
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:30,720
Please keep in mind that you need to give birth to a child.

151
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,620
You need to secure your position.

152
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:38,220
If you don't have a dream, take my dream instead,

153
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:42,150
my dream of becoming the King of this nation.

154
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:06,050
You can't even solve Pythagoras' theorem.

155
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:09,010
There is no one who is good at arithmetics?

156
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,960
I apologize, Your Majesty.

157
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,960
We should try harder not to get played by those old men.

158
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,440
I need to see their intellect with my own eyes.

159
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:27,990
You know best the real reason why I need arithmetic.

160
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,330
Your Majesty.

161
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:40,350
How rude! How dare the intern talk to the King.

162
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:49,700
The water that was gathered is going bad, and the valleys have become dry.

163
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,440
No life can be found in Joseon.

164
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,610
Joseon. The Joseon from history?

165
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,060
It's awesome.

166
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,820
What is this? Then can I return when it rains again?

167
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,940
The last time rain fell was now three years ago.

168
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:09,230
Three years?

169
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:14,680
Child from the Heavens?

170
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,860
Unfortunately, I don't believe in things I can't see.

171
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,050
Presumably,

172
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,990
if I don't like what my eyes see,

173
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:28,250
I need to know the logic and principle of it, no matter how strange it is.

174
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:33,960
Your topknot is unique, and your clothes are peculiar...
Are you from Ming?

175
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,920
Huh?

176
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,250
Oh, my phone...

177
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,050
The rain in this field.

178
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,440
Exactly what is this?

179
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:51,650
Ah, I think you misunderstood, but I'm just a high school senior.

180
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,980
I think I came from the future through the rain...

181
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,130
The future?

182
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:59,730
I know it sounds absurd,

183
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,310
but this is not rain, but it's an app that tells you the weather.

184
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:06,730
You can know the weather from this thing?

185
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,360
What?

186
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,550
I seriously hope it's not broken.

187
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,880
- Where did it go, the rain that was falling here?
- I turned it off, so the battery won't go out.

188
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,880
Talk in a way that I can understand!

189
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,650
How about you cut one of his arms off?

190
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,840
Ah, that's right.

191
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,160
Ah! Wait! This is a real sword! Wait, wait!

192
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,140
I-I'm from the future! I know everything! Ask me anything!
I-I'm good at history!

193
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:37,390
J-Joseon? TaeJeongTaeSeMunDanSe? (acronym for the names of the Kings of Joseon) Ah, Teacher!

194
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:40,330
I  am a mathematician, arithmetics!

195
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,870
- Really?
- Yes!

196
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:48,030
Well... Yes!

197
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:51,260
The sum of the short leg and the long leg is 7, and the difference between the hypotenuse and the short leg leg is 2.

198
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,040
I will give you two days to find the lengths of the short leg, long leg, and hypotenuse.

199
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,140
What's this? I can't read this...

200
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,350
You don't know hanja? (Traditional Chinese characters)

201
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,630
But this...

202
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:09,040
Pythagoras.

203
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:18,470
One, three...

204
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:21,440
How can you write without ink?

205
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,500
Oh, this is a pen.

206
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,120
What am I doing here? I didn't even take the SATs...

207
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,660
Pen?

208
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,350
X is...

209
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,900
Three, four, five.

210
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:48,210
Three, four, five? How can you solve this so fast when the scholar used three days to solve and still got it wrong?

211
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:53,320
In the future, if you are a high school senior  (pronounced as "gosam"), you can solve this.

212
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:58,380
You mean, in the future, people voluntarily become eunuchs (pronounced as "gosam") to study arithmetics?

213
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,580
Yes... Well, most people become high school seniors (pronounced as "gosam").

214
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,880
That's very incredible.

215
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,750
All matters are connected to math.

216
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:12,830
Okay. Eunuch. You have to teach me all your arithmetic skills from now on.

217
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,300
Huh?

218
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,170
Are you being sincere, Teacher?

219
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:20,200
If you teach me everything truthfully, I will exempt you from the punishments.

220
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,690
Chief of Eunuchs.

221
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,090
Your Majesty.

222
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:32,900
© ptpersonal.site All rights reserved.

223
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,150
I think you'll be very useful.

224
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,390
Me?

225
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:45,910
You can leave when rain comes.

226
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,290
If so, me too.

227
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,060
Deal.

228
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,440
Prepayment.

229
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,600
Change...

230
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:12,140
I think I've seen this from my history textbook. Is this a rain gauge?

231
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,680
A rain gauge?

232
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:19,610
Uh... Doesn't this measure the amount of rain?

233
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,330
Drink with that or you can die from thirst.

234
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:28,730
Wait, the toilet...

235
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:35,090
Ah, you can do the big one in the yard at the back.

236
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:40,940
This is the rent money until next month.

237
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,800
Alright. Don't be late from now on.

238
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,410
Noona!

239
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:09,340
Well, I don't have another place to stay.

240
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:24,720
These are a eunuch's clothes... Ah, Teacher, why?

241
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,530
A "laugh-eunuch" (a eunuch that makes the King laugh) is a great job.

242
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:31,830
His Majesty won't laugh no matter what you do. So don't do anything.

243
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,950
Don't even try, you rascal.

244
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:38,870
But there are so many pretty skirts here...

245
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:44,580
How long have you been a eunuch? You are still looking for a dress?

246
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:48,260
If you look like a girl, would His Majesty have you near him?

247
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:54,620
You need to be thankful that you were born a man in Joseon!

248
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:57,800
Huh? A man?

249
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:03,050
Isn't a eunuch a man? He's a man!

250
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:07,160
Have pride! Have we sinned? A eunuch is still a man!

251
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:12,070
Straighten up your shoulders! Put your waist down! Gather your hands.

252
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:12,450
Eunuch?

253
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,240
Eunuch?

254
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:19,950
I guess it's better to be a man in Joseon.

255
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,960
Uh? This is all Hanja!

256
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,250
I need to know which king he is

257
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:28,250
to come up with a plan.

258
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,550
Arabian...  Arabian...

259
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,750
They have their own characters, too?

260
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,550
Do you really not know numbers?

261
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:51,350
This man, seriously...

262
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:55,250
Then forget that and do this problem first.

263
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:58,250
Hey, teach me that formula first.

264
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,750
What formula?

265
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,950
You have to know the numbers first.

266
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,720
Then, start with this, and

267
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,430
I'll tell you after you take a test.

268
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,570
A test?

269
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:17,300
I'm famous for not getting any math problems wrong when I was the crown prince.

270
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,070
Do you think I became a king automatically?

271
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:23,150
Really? Then how about finger flick if you get one wrong?

272
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,130
But, talking about you.

273
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:35,710
How can you stare at my eyes?

274
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,370
You have no fear.

275
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:39,120
Well, that...

276
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,990
How can I teach if I don't look at you?

277
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:51,250
It's been a while since I faced someone like this.

278
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:56,170
They're always bowing.

279
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:59,980
You're saying a test? I should loosen up my hands.

280
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,830
Then, should we start?

281
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,500
Please repeat.

282
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,400
Four.

283
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,520
Ugh, let me just eat it!
(The rooster that woke her up.)

284
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:29,440
When will it rain?

285
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,920
I want to go back.

286
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:39,750
Three plus seven equals...

287
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,600
Ten.

288
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:55,140
Omo, omo.

289
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,450
Ah, this is mine!

290
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:20,310
So frustrating...

291
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,430
What are you looking at?

292
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,320
A bomb?

293
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,290
Your Majesty! Aigoo, aigoo...

294
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:05,500
You... Come in when I call you!

295
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,840
My gosh...

296
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,630
Please reconsider your command.

297
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:30,720
Please reconsider your command!

298
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:46,600
© ptpersonal.site All rights reserved.

299
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:59,160
Times table, times table.

300
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,630
- Four times nine?
- Thirty-six.

301
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,720
Times table.

302
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,870
- Six times three.
- Eighteen. Times tables.

303
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,430
- Eight times five.
- Err...

304
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:10,490
Wrong, wrong!

305
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,350
Your Majesty! How do you dare?

306
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:22,980
Your Majesty, are you okay?

307
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,340
It's alright.

308
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:35,020
It's alright. This eunuch is surely a guy. I can tell from his hand.

309
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,740
Get out!

310
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,210
Alright, again.

311
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:42,090
Why aren't you sitting down and playing your woodwind?

312
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,980
Times table.

313
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,820
- Eight times two.
- Sixteen.

314
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,120
Sixteen?

315
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,470
You said eight times two!

316
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:53,770
I said eight times one! Right?

317
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:55,470
Eight times one.

318
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:58,760
Come on, baby!

319
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:03,690
Yes!

320
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,170
Again.

321
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:08,320
Let's do it slowly.

322
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,940
Times table, times table. One times eight?

323
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,930
- Ten—
- One times eight equals ten? I got you!

324
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:16,620
Come here, come here!

325
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,440
Hey, Your Majesty, this is unfair!

326
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:23,970
I should've cut your arm off already. Hold on tightly.

327
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:28,100
- Ahh!
- Her Majesty the Queen is entering!

328
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:33,100
- Hey, hurry!
- Oh my!

329
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,710
- Switch.
- This.

330
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:46,030
Her Majesty the Queen is here!

331
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,570
Enter.

332
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:50,720
I came to visit you because I haven't been able to see you for a while.

333
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,130
I'm worried about your health day and night.

334
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,580
So—

335
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:09,400
I haven't seen you before.

336
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:16,320
Yes, Your Highness.

337
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:24,760
Like you can see, I am very well studying the tunes of Joseon.

338
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:30,130
I can't believe you actually made this yourself. You have a skillful talent.

339
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:34,500
Well, let's take a look.

340
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:40,110
Your Majesty, I have brought the royal meal.

341
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,740
Why are you next to His Majesty?

342
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:51,680
You became his loyal dog.

343
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:56,610
The same goes for you.

344
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:01,580
Please eat.

345
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,130
Everyone please leave.

346
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,480
Well, say ah.

347
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,890
- Ahhh. Bigger.
- Ah, ah, ah.

348
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:33,360
- Ahhh. Bigger. Ahh.
- Ah, ah, ah.

349
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:42,120
How dare the low class dirt spoon (the poor) get tempted by my food?

350
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:49,560
The people don't have any food to eat, but someone has a gold spoon, meat dishes, and soup!

351
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:56,040
Hey, low class, I have to be healthy in order to stop the drought.

352
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:01,470
Low class, you keep on calling me that, but dear Gold Spoon, the taste of the lower class is so much better!

353
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:04,330
The taste of the lower class? Don't joke around with me.

354
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:06,800
You want to see?

355
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,040
Where is that kitchen that Jang Geum unni worked in?

356
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:18,240
How... How can a man come into a place like this?

357
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,080
Ah, give me two minutes. Okay?

358
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,240
Hot water...

359
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,160
Ugh, I hate him.

360
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:53,060
Yes... This is it!

361
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:05,260
Give me.

362
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:08,240
It's delicious, right?

363
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:14,380
Whoa, perfect. Wow...

364
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,280
This is so nice... I have to admit.

365
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,140
So good, ah.

366
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,780
It's tasty, huh?

367
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:23,260
It's spicy, isn't it?

368
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,760
It's spicy, but I can eat it.

369
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,380
Aigoo, you eat well. Ohgoo Ohgoo.

370
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:32,780
Five times nine is forty-five.
("Oh" is five and "goo" is nine.)

371
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:35,740
Hey...

372
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:39,640
This is good isn't it?

373
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:51,770
There is fire in my stomach. Bring the toilet kit, no, call the toilet maid.

374
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:56,330
Where is that rotten eunuch?

375
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,740
Don't you know Heo Joon?
(A court physician in the Joseon dynasty who wrote the defining text on traditional Korean medicine.)

376
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:07,990
I thought you were casting a spell with the intention of treason.

377
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:12,610
Hey, look. This is the stomach, and these are the intestines.

378
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:16,370
This is where you need to digest your food, but this is where you got an upset stomach.

379
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:21,090
So, just do better. Okay?

380
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,880
How can a king be so weak?

381
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,880
You said math was important and you are now believing in superstition?

382
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:31,770
How can I trust something when I can't see it?

383
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,450
Look at me. Here, try putting your hand here.

384
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:38,990
You can feel something beating, right? That is your heart.

385
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:43,900
I don't know, it does not beat.

386
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,210
How is that possible?

387
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,770
How dare you touch my body...

388
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:53,620
No, but you can't go forever without knowing it. When there is a person you like and your heart beats,

389
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:57,300
you know that it is your heart.

390
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,660
Then let me feel yours.

391
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,990
What?

392
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:09,080
Well, since I'm a high school senior, I know a lot of things, so trust me.

393
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,290
Don't believe in superstitions like that.

394
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:14,670
You're more...

395
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,340
You're more useful than I thought. Let's go.

396
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,890
♬ What I want you've got but it might be hard to handle ♬

397
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:35,700
Here, you'll find the heart.

398
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:40,050
The organs. These are the kidneys. Watch out so they won't be taken away.

399
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:45,740
This is the brain. Your brain needs to be good so that...

400
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:49,380
Here are the medical texts.

401
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:56,540
The intestines, the stomach... We should dissect him but it's too tedious, so let's skip. The esophagus, the brain...

402
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,780
I'm sorry, sorry!

403
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,290
Please bring my clothes.

404
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,840
Oh my goodness, I apologize.

405
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,680
Here are the anatomy books.

406
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:11,750
- It gets light energy...
- Energy?

407
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:14,010
Oh, strength!

408
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:16,530
Let's take a picture.

409
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:22,460
Please smile!

410
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:31,540
♬ Well you, you make my dreams come true ♬

411
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,900
One, two, three.

412
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:40,060
You're good!

413
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:42,940
♬ You make my dreams come true ♬

414
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:46,640
♬ You, you, you, you, you ♬

415
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:48,020
Show me that, too.

416
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:52,040
Here are the agriculture books.

417
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:59,420
Distribute the texts to each district, and make them adapt it to the soil.

418
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:05,950
And, these are tangerines from Tamra (Jeju Island) to award the ones who helped on this project.

419
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:08,830
♬ You make my dreams come true ♬

420
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:10,740
♬ You, you, you ♬

421
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:15,720
Those old men who don't even know math were dumbfounded. Those faces.

422
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,100
Here.

423
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:22,810
I didn't know you could be this useful.

424
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,910
Oh.

425
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,240
This is something that should be savored for at least four days.

426
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,180
Hey, it's only a tangerine!

427
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,840
Only... What?

428
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,180
This, this brat over here

429
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:46,310
doesn't know a person's generosity. Do you have a beggar in your stomach? I hate you, Eunuch.

430
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:49,460
I didn't know a tangerine was so precious.

431
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:54,310
Ah, whatever. Fine, this is not precious.

432
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:56,040
You can leave now.

433
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:00,670
- Leaving.
- Ah, wait.

434
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:06,530
I... I forgot to ask you about this.

435
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:10,180
So, the left are sufficient conditions

436
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:15,300
and the right are necessary conditions. Prove it to me before you leave.

437
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,580
Ah, I hate proving things!

438
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:22,560
Just memorize what there is! Why are you trying to understand it?

439
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:27,900
Outside will be dark and everything, so be confused and lost on your way back.

440
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:32,450
By the way, there are countless souls wandering around in the city.

441
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:38,090
Ah, I really didn't know that a tangerine was so precious in Joseon!

442
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:41,440
Do you think I'm like this because of a tangerine? Who do you think I am?

443
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,420
Leave now.

444
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,660
Hey, Eunuch.

445
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:48,480
It's about the tangerine. It is.

446
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,480
Go get it.

447
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:02,270
Oh, really.

448
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:04,940
Ha!

449
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,750
Soccer at night? What is this?

450
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:11,860
There are too many people watching in the afternoon.

451
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:15,940
How can you not give me a piece of that precious tangerine? You're shameless.

452
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:18,810
I was right. It was about the tangerine.

453
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:20,130
What are you doing? Go get the ball.

454
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:23,560
The goalpost is here, but you didn't even score one goal yet.

455
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,680
You don't even run! What are you doing?

456
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:32,460
A king has his own image. How can a king run?

457
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:37,290
You don't have any common sense when it comes to kings.

458
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:39,940
When I come to think about it, there are so many things kings can't do.

459
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:43,750
You can't even say what you want, run as you want, because of your subjects.

460
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,230
Can't you run?

461
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:50,200
Can't you live doing what you want? You're the king.

462
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,370
Come here.

463
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:55,590
- No, no.
- Come here!

464
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:58,350
No, I don't want to.

465
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:03,230
Ah, you can't even run anyway.

466
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:23,820
Do you want to die?

467
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,260
Oh, but see how much you ran.

468
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:30,860
I don't know when was the last time I ran around like this.

469
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,980
I can't even remember.

470
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:39,240
But it doesn't feel bad.

471
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:57,210
Tell me the truth. How dare you deceive me?

472
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:07,240
Ah... My heart after running... You're talking about the heart, right?

473
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,250
Forget that.

474
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,120
Give it to me.

475
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:22,970
Oh! This? Here I'll just give it to you.

476
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:25,660
Never mind. Let's go.

477
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,970
Hey.

478
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:35,100
I was about to go out incognito.

479
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:38,500
If you're going the same way, you can join me.

480
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:49,400
It's been way past my leaving time.

481
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,190
So what? It's my will, I'm the king.

482
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:56,040
Wait right here. It's an order.

483
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,720
Wait.

484
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:10,840
I haven't done this alone before.

485
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,140
Here.

486
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:16,980
Your Majesty, if there is anything you need?

487
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:19,590
I'm okay.

488
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:21,400
So.

489
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:26,060
Let's see.

490
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:13,840
You can't go forever without knowing it. When there is a person you like and your heart beats,

491
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:17,120
you know that it is your heart.

492
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:29,410
If you sleep here, your lips will turn.
(Cold temperatures will make your lips turn.)

493
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:52,990
Even if he tries to be a good king, he is only a man.

494
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:59,950
I have prepared everything for the night of intimacy.

495
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,600
Have you heard of the powder of a mating snake?
(An aphrodisiac)

496
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:11,720
When ddeukbokki is served, he finishes the whole dish.

497
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:17,510
So, if the the powder is added to the dish...

498
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:32,480
Um, how long did you wait yesterday?

499
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:36,300
Well, a little.

500
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:41,690
I had so much to do that I forgot the promise.

501
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:43,850
I couldn't keep my promise.

502
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:47,930
I won't be able to leave undercover because of all the work I have to do.

503
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:53,580
That, um, well...

504
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:58,840
You don't even seem to eat well in your residence.

505
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:03,820
How about you look for another place?

506
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:05,550
What?

507
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:09,230
Whatever.

508
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:12,480
Let's have class.

509
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:23,920
If he doesn't come look for you, go to his bedroom yourself.

510
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:28,860
3.14.

511
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:33,560
The area is pi times r squared. And if you multiply that by the height?

512
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:37,020
Are you listening?

513
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:39,520
Yes.

514
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:43,380
Yes. Uh, that's very interesting. Did you say it was pi?

515
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,140
Yes. Uh, that's very interesting. Did you say it was pi?

516
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:50,140
Tell him that I'm here.

517
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:53,660
The Queen is entering.

518
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:03,380
I can see why you came here, but please leave since I still have work left.

519
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:06,990
What are you working so hard for?

520
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:13,810
Even if there is a drought or disease, does it matter in the palace?

521
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:21,670
Now he will be burning because of the aphrodisiac.

522
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:26,000
What are you doing?

523
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:30,680
Don't act like a good king.

524
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:36,460
To be honest, you are just fighting for power.

525
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:48,000
I wish to be a good king, so power is my priority.

526
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,750
So I don't want to lose.

527
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:59,130
Your Majesty. I'm lonely.

528
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:02,510
- Look at me.
- Pardon me?

529
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:04,760
How dare I look at your face?

530
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,770
It's okay. Look.

531
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:16,030
Who isn't lonely in this palace?

532
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:20,090
So you don't need to force yourself.

533
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:31,040
So...

534
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,970
Ah, So...

535
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:40,230
So, ah.

536
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:46,270
Eunuch! Eunuch, why are you like this?

537
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:50,710
Why is your face so red?  Eunuch, Eunuch!

538
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:54,380
Eunuch!

539
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,360
Eunuch! Eunuch!

540
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,140
I can't call the royal doctor.

541
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:09,560
- Eunuch!
- Air conditioner...

542
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,900
What?

543
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:13,610
Eunuch!

544
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:16,410
Air conditioner...

545
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:22,210
I had a nightmare. I dreamed about a ghost.

546
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:24,080
About a ghost.

547
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,300
What are you doing? Ouch!

548
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:36,060
I dreamed about a ghost.

549
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:38,530
Be quiet!

550
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:41,060
I told you to be quiet! What is this?

551
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:47,120
You're so handsome, but you're so mean. You're making my heart flutter.

552
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:52,240
Are you filming The Moon Embracing the Sun? Compared with Kim Soo Hyun...

553
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:56,480
Hey! Keep quiet!

554
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:08,500
What are you doing?

555
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:13,900
Eunuch?

556
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:16,940
Eunuch, hey!

557
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:29,550
Gold Spoon, you are horrible. I am going to leave as soon as it rains.

558
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:34,230
Poison! Bring poison so I can give it to him!

559
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:37,500
Hah, he is worthy of execution.

560
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:41,260
Hey, do you think I let you be with me because I like it?

561
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:44,310
I like you a bit.

562
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:56,900
But I am high schooler and you're a king, you pretty bastard.

563
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:03,050
I will throw you away if you're useless. Leave when it rains!

564
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:07,530
When it rains, I'll leave.

565
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:09,050
Really.

566
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:16,370
Let's live a comfy life.

567
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:36,770
♬ The peach lipgloss on your full lips ♬

568
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:44,600
♬  put me in a daze  ♬

569
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:48,120
♬ which lasts all day ♬

570
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:51,520
Hey, why am I like this?

571
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,140
Oh.

572
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:03,140
♬ Wow, wow, even your shocking words are pretty ♬

573
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:11,220
♬ I can't express it using any earthly languages ♬

574
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:19,140
♬ I stutter whenever I stand in front of you ♬

575
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:28,220
♬  Talking about stuff today and tomorrow which doesn't make sense  ♬

576
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:36,110
♬  While you are fidgeting, my love is increasing  ♬

577
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:40,720
Do you really want to die? Did you drink rice wine?

578
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:44,660
Oh... I don't remember...

579
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:48,220
Get up quickly. You should leave before the sun rises.

580
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:51,720
I'll go now.

581
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,360
- Let's go together.
- Pardon?

582
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,860
I'll take you there.

583
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:10,050
When I was a prince, my goal was to become the crown prince, and when I became the crown prince,  I thought I could do anything when I became king.

584
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:14,010
But that's not the end.

585
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:18,850
The higher you climb, the more you have to tolerate.

586
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:25,090
I thought Joseon's Gold Spoon was a really comfy spot, but I guess not.

587
00:52:25,090 --> 00:52:29,790
If I fulfill my wish through you, then I will grant you a spot in the office.

588
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:34,070
Nice house, and yeah a nice horse for you to ride.

589
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:39,370
No... No thanks. I can't even ride a horse anyway,

590
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:46,310
and because I will return when it rains again.

591
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:50,910
Then, should I tell you this now, or not?

592
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:58,470
Anyway, I'm thankful.

593
00:52:58,470 --> 00:52:59,830
Oh?

594
00:52:59,830 --> 00:53:05,650
To be honest, I can breathe now because of you. Thanks a lot.

595
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:14,680
Me too... I'm not smart, but I feel good that I can teach someone.

596
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:19,010
If your head is bad, exactly who has a good head?

597
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:25,660
Then how about we become friends?

598
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:31,880
Don't think of me as king, but as a friend—man to man.

599
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,040
Friends?

600
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,110
Okay. I like it, friend.

601
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:46,800
So you live here. I don't know about a horse,

602
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,170
but I think you'll need a tile-roofed house.

603
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:53,950
Alright. Then see you tomorrow, friend.

604
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:56,520
Friend!

605
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:03,380
I will eat it well.

606
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:07,400
Noona.

607
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:10,760
Why are you wearing this? Shhh.

608
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:17,360
He kept that sky guy next to him?

609
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:22,880
Even if he has the king's heart, how dare he mock the queen?

610
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,240
Anyway,

611
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:30,250
he is a criminal you have a warrant for.

612
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:33,660
We have a reason to execute him.

613
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:36,620
Take the criminal out.

614
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:46,470
Bring the criminal!

615
00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:50,550
In the name of Her Majesty the Queen's orders,

616
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:54,660
his crime will be paid with his death.

617
00:54:54,660 --> 00:55:00,640
Could you explain why you kept such a criminal near you?

618
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:06,530
Enter.

619
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:18,140
This is a plate to measure the amount of the rain drops.

620
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:20,780
Did you make it?

621
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:21,460
Yes.

622
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:26,960
It was for drinking, but it was modified under his (Eunuch's) order.

623
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,780
© ptpersonal.site All rights reserved.

624
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:33,290
As you can see, that person has great knowledge,

625
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:38,140
so I kept him by my side instead of a eunuch to come up with a plan for rain.

626
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:41,890
That person also knows how to measure it.

627
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:47,760
Your Majesty, what do you mean by measuring rain during a drought? We need to stop the rain calling ceremony now.

628
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:53,010
How could we let someone who mocked the queen stay alive?

629
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:55,660
Please reconsider your command.

630
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:59,390
Please reconsider your command.

631
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:02,970
Tie him up!

632
00:56:07,850 --> 00:56:12,620
Then, we can't blame nature

633
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:15,410
and do nothing.

634
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:22,630
The people don't even have water to drink, but we are eating meat with rice and soup.

635
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:29,650
So, preparing for rain during drought and using the water from the flood to prepare for drought,

636
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:35,770
is what we, who eat the rice that the people farm, should do.

637
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:44,690
If he is so useful to our people.

638
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:50,690
Then, we should test out his skills first.

639
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:57,890
Like Your Majesty said, to prepare for the rain after the long drought.

640
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:07,320
Who are you?

641
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:14,780
If people could know the time on a cloudy day without sun,

642
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:17,790
how nice would that be?

643
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:32,580
Tell the time without sun? In Joseon, the sun is the time.

644
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:37,780
Wait, doesn't the sun symbolize me, the king?

645
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:40,290
This is a trap, pretending to test that child.

646
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:44,530
He is challenging you and your study group.

647
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:47,790
A fortnight is not enough.

648
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:51,990
Since he has become useless, you need to throw him away.

649
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:59,610
I heard he forbade you from entering the court.

650
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:03,240
I'm not Dong Yi or Dae Jang Geum.

651
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:07,630
I'm just a eunuch. Do you think they'll really kill me?

652
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:10,140
Yes.

653
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:15,990
It's normal to be thrown away after becoming useless.

654
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:21,420
If you have time to talk to me, just solve the damn problem.

655
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:27,740
Then... If you help me one more time...

656
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:31,140
I will do the calculations.

657
00:58:32,370 --> 00:58:37,340
I was using you in the first place, to earn the king's favor.

658
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:39,910
Let's survive individually.

659
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:41,210
Oh?

660
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:29,630
I have a nosebleed.

661
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:33,040
Unbelievable.

662
01:03:19,570 --> 01:03:22,500
It will earn him enough time.

663
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:30,400
I believe that he can do it.

664
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:42,120
I solved it. Wow, I solved it!

665
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:05,540
It's raining.

666
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:10,370
When rain falls, you can leave.

667
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:17,070
I will return when it rains.

668

684
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:16,190
It's done.

685
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:37,110
I thought you could measure the time with water,

686
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:41,220
because in the 3rd block, the basket was full of water.

687
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:50,470
In my life, I have never worked as if my life depended on it.

688
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:53,570
Because if I couldn't do it even if I tried hard,

689
01:06:53,570 --> 01:06:57,790
then, it would be proving how useless I am.

690
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:02,580
But, I really did my best this time.

691
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:08,290
But to be honest, I'm really bad at math.

692
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:23,490
It's okay.

693
01:07:26,090 --> 01:07:30,160
I also put a lot of effort into it, but

694
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:45,500
I don't think there is an answer.
